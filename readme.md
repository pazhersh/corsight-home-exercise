## Forward

I would like to start by apoligizing - I am aware that this is meant to be ran on a linux machine (specifically ubuntu), but since I only own windows machines I never tested it on a linux one.

That said, I hope that most commands will work on both operating systems, as python should make the overall environment irrelevant for most of its usage.
